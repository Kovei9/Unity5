1. Scoring system!
2. A player can sit on top of another one and gain points depending on how long they sit there, so if you follow the enemies movements you can win!
3. Boxes move
4. I wanted to add goals where you can push the enemy player into them and score more points
5. I also wanted to add enemies that you have to avoid.
6. I wasn't able to get all of these functioning, but I tried!

Unity 7 and 8:
I added moving objects, and some that will give you a jumping boost. I added better visuals, and just made it a better game in general.
I kept the game leap frog, and every time I tried to add power ups it would break so I stopped doing that. But for now you just get an advantage depending on what object you jump on.
